# Zomato_End-to-End_Data_Analysis
End-to-end data analysis project using food delivery data processed in PostgreSQL. Performed data cleaning and business analysis using SQL with aggregations and ranking logic. Integrated results into Microsoft Excel via ODBC to build an interactive dashboard delivering revenue and city-level insights.

**End-to-End Workflow**

1. Data Engineering in PostgreSQL

- Raw CSV data was imported into PostgreSQL for structured storage and analysis.

2. Data Processing Included:

- Data type standardization

- Handling missing values

- Date formatting and transformation

- Category normalization

- Creation of derived metrics (revenue-based measures)

- Feature engineering for business insights

3.  SQL Analysis 

- Total Revenue & Order Volume

- Advanced SQL concepts used:

- GROUP BY and Aggregations

- CASE WHEN

- RANK() / ROW_NUMBER() window functions

- Conditional filtering

- Sorting and top-N analysis

4.  ODBC Integration

An ODBC connection was established between PostgreSQL and Microsoft Excel to dynamically extract processed data. This enabled seamless transition from backend analytics to front-end dashboard visualization.

5.  Dashboard Overview & Business Insights
